    "\n",
    "Differences between multithreading and multiprocessing:\n",
    "- In multithreading, we will be able to run multiple instances of a program/function into a single processor core whereas in multiprocessing we will be able to do the same thing but into different processor cores.\n",
    "- In multithreading, all the instances of a program are being execueted in an alternate manner whereas in multiprocessing all the instances are being executed in a parallel manner.\n",
    "- Both have their own pros and cons in terms of utilization of space and time, multithreading is more and less efficient respectively. multiprocessing behaves exactly opposite to it in respective cases. "
