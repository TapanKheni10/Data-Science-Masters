CNNs leverage convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn hierarchical features from the input images. Here's an overview of key components and processes involved in analyzing image data using CNNs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Convolutional Layers:\n",
        "- Convolution Operation: Convolutional layers apply convolution operations to the input image. Convolution involves sliding a small filter (also known as a kernel) across the image, computing the dot product at each position. This operation allows the network to detect local patterns such as edges, textures, and simple shapes.\n",
        "- Feature Maps: The result of the convolution operation is a feature map, which highlights the presence of different features in the input image. Multiple filters are used to generate multiple feature maps, each capturing different aspects of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Activation Functions:\n",
        "- ReLU Activation: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions are commonly used after convolutional operations. ReLU introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data. ReLU replaces negative pixel values with zero, enabling the network to model more intricate patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Pooling Layers:\n",
        "- Pooling Operation: Pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, reducing the computational load and increasing the receptive field. Max pooling and average pooling are common techniques, selecting the maximum or average value from a group of neighboring pixels, respectively.\n",
        "- Spatial Hierarchies: Pooling helps create a spatial hierarchy of features, capturing higher-level information by progressively summarizing and discarding less important details.\n",

        "4. Flattening and Fully Connected Layers:\n",
        "- Flattening: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector. This vector serves as the input to fully connected layers.\n",
        "- Fully Connected Layers: Fully connected layers process the flattened vector, learning complex relationships between features. These layers are similar to those in traditional neural networks, connecting every input to every output. They often end with a softmax activation for classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Backpropagation and Training:\n",
        "- Backpropagation: CNNs are trained using backpropagation, where the network adjusts its weights to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. The backpropagation algorithm calculates gradients and updates weights throughout the network.\n",
