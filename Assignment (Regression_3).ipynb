    "**1) What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression models to address some of the limitations of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Let's explore Ridge Regression and how it differs from OLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "- Ridge Regression is a method that adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function to reduce the model complexity and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Function:\n",
    "- Ridge minimizes: RSS + λ * Σ(βj²)\n",
    "  Where \n",
    "  - RSS is the residual sum of squares, \n",
    "  - λ (lambda) is the regularization parameter, and \n",
    "  - βj are the model coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization:\n",
    "- It uses L2 regularization, which adds the sum of squared coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect on Coefficients:\n",
    "- Ridge shrinks the coefficients towards zero but rarely makes them exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from Ordinary Least Squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective Function:\n",
    "- OLS minimizes only the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares).\n",
    "- Ridge minimizes RSS plus a penalty term.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bias-Variance Trade-off:\n",
    "- OLS provides unbiased estimates but can have high variance.\n",
    "- Ridge introduces a small amount of bias but reduces variance, often leading to better predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multicollinearity:\n",
    "- OLS can be unstable when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "- Ridge handles multicollinearity well by shrinking correlated features together.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Selection:\n",
    "- OLS doesn't perform feature selection.\n",
    "- Ridge reduces the impact of less important features but keeps all features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Regularization Parameter:\n",
    "- OLS doesn't have a regularization parameter.\n",
    "- Ridge has λ, which controls the strength of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Performance on High-Dimensional Data:\n",
    "- OLS can overfit when the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations.\n",
    "- Ridge performs better in high-dimensional settings by constraining coefficient magnitudes."

    "**2) What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity:\n",
    "- Assumption: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "- Implication: The model assumes that the dependent variable can be predicted as a linear combination of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence:\n",
    "- Assumption: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Implication: There should be no significant correlation between separate observations, especially important in time series or clustered data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No Perfect Multicollinearity:\n",
    "- Assumption: While Ridge Regression can handle multicollinearity better than OLS, it still assumes no perfect multicollinearity among predictors.\n",
    "- Implication: No predictor can be perfectly predicted by a linear combination of other predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Correct Model Specification:\n",
    "- Assumption: All relevant predictors are included, and irrelevant ones are excluded.\n",
    "- Implication: The model should be properly specified in terms of included variables and their functional form."

    "\n",
    "It is a hyperparameter means an machine learning engineer can set the value of it according to the usecase.\n",

    "**4) Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection in the same way as Lasso. It shrinks coefficients towards zero but rarely sets them exactly to zero. However, it can be used indirectly for feature importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coefficient magnitude: \n",
    "- Larger absolute coefficients after regularization may indicate more important features.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Stability: \n",
    "- It stabilizes coefficient estimates when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Shrinkage: \n",
    "- Correlated features have their coefficients shrunk together, reducing their individual impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variance reduction: \n",
    "- It reduces the variance of the estimates, which is inflated by multicollinearity in OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Unique solution: \n",
    "- Ridge always provides a unique solution, even with perfect multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Often leads to better predictive performance on new data compared to OLS in multicollinear settings.\n",

    "6. Bias-variance trade-off: \n",
    "- Introduces a small bias to greatly reduce variance, beneficial in multicollinear scenarios.\n",

    "**8) Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, In general it is not recommanded to use Ridge regression for solving time series related problems. But with certain assumptions it is possible to do so like adding lagged variables (include past values of the target and predictors as features) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to check for time-series specific assumptions and potentially combine with other time-series techniques for optimal results. Ridge Regression can be particularly useful in high-dimensional time-series problems with many predictors."
