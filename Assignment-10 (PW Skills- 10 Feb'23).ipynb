    "1) Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, open() function is used to open a file in Python. The function returns a file object.\n",
    "Different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "- Read only ('r'): It is the default access mode. It opens the text file for reading and positions the file handle at the start of the file. If Python finds that the file does not exist, it throws an I/O error and does not create a file with the specified name.  \n",
    "- Write only ('w'): It is used for writing files. If the file isn't in the folder, a file with the specified name is created. If the file exists, the data is truncated and then over-written. The file handle is positioned at the start of the file.\n",
    "- Read and write ('r+'): You can both read and write on files opened with this access mode. It positions the handle at the start of the file. If the file isn't in the directory, it raises an I/O error.\n",
    "- Write and read ('w+'): Like the previous mode, you can both read and write on files opened with this access mode. It positions the handle at the start of the file. If the file isn't in the folder, it creates a new file. Furthermore, if the specified file exists, the data in it is truncated and over-written.\n",
    "- Appened only: This mode opens the file up for writing. If the particular file isn't in the directory, a new one with the same name is created. However, unlike other modes, the handle is located at the end of the file. Thus, the data entered is appended after all of the existing data.\n",
    "- Appened and read ('a+'): It is used to read and write files in Python. It works similarly to the previous mode. If the file isn't available in the directory, one with the same name is created. Alternatively, if the file is available, the entered data is appended after the existing data."
