    "**1) What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression method that combines features of both Lasso and Ridge regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a combination of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties\n",
    "- Introduces two hyperparameters: alpha (overall regularization strength) and l1_ratio (balance between L1 and L2)\n",
    "- Can perform feature selection and handle multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**vs. Ordinary Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- Elastic Net includes regularization, OLS does not\n",
    "- Better at handling multicollinearity and can perform feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**vs. Lasso Regression:**\n",
    "- Elastic Net retains some correlated features that Lasso might exclude\n",
    "- More stable in the presence of highly correlated features\n",
    "\n",
    "**vs. Ridge Regression:**\n",
    "- Elastic Net can perform feature selection, Ridge cannot\n",
    "- Elastic Net produces sparser models\n",
    "\n",
    "**vs. Both Lasso and Ridge:**\n",
    "- More flexible due to the combination of L1 and L2 penalties\n",
    "- Often outperforms when the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations"

    "\n",

    "**3) What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Elastic Net Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature selection: Can reduce coefficients to zero, selecting important features\n",
    "- Handles multicollinearity: Effectively manages groups of correlated features\n",
    "- Flexibility: Balances between Lasso and Ridge regression\n",
    "- Stability: More stable than Lasso when features are highly correlated\n",
    "- Improved predictions: Often outperforms Lasso and Ridge in various scenarios\n",
    "- Handles high-dimensional data: Effective when features outnumber observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complexity: Two hyperparameters to tune (alpha and l1_ratio)\n",
    "- Interpretability: Can be less interpretable than simpler models\n",
    "- Computational cost: May be slower to train than Lasso or Ridge\n",
    "- Non-linear relationships: Does not directly capture non-linear feature interactions\n",
    "- Feature scaling: Sensitive to the scale of input features"
