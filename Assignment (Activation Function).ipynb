    "\n",
    "In context of artificial neural networks, an activation function is a mathematical operation or equation that applied to each nodes(or neurons) inside the network. It introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and representation in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions serve two primary purposes in neural networks:\n",
    "1) Introducing Non-Linearity:\n",
    "- Without non-linear activation functions, the entire neural network would behave like a linear model, regardless of its depth.\n",
    "2) Determining the Output of a Neurons:\n",
    "- The activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated (i.e., contribute to the output) or not based on the input it receives."

    "2) Addressing the Vanishing Gradient Problem:\n",
    "- During backpropagation, gradients are computed and used to update weights. Some activation functions, such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh), suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients become very small, leading to slow or stalled learning. ReLU and its variants help mitigate this problem by allowing for more significant gradients.\n",

    "\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function, also known as the logistic function, is a commonly used activation function in neural networks, especially in the output layer for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the sigmoid activation function works:\n",
    "- Output Range: The sigmoid function squashes its input to the range (0, 1), which makes it suitable for binary classification problems. The output can be interpreted as a probability, where values closer to 0 indicate a probability of belonging to one class, and values closer to 1 indicate a probability of belonging to the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1) Output Interpretability: The main advantage of the sigmoid function is its ability to produce outputs in a interpretable range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "2) Smoothness and Differentiability: The sigmoid function is smooth and differentiable, which is important for gradient-based optimization algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1) Vanishing Gradient Problem: The sigmoid function tends to saturate for extreme input values, leading to very small gradients.\n",
    "2) Not Zero-Centered: The sigmoid function is not zero-centered, which can make optimization more challenging, especially when used in hidden layers of deep neural networks. This can lead to zigzagging during gradient descent."
